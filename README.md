Mid-Project Report — “Personalized Course Recommendation System” 
1. Task Breakdown Structure (TBS) Task ID Task Description Status Remarks / Notes 1 Data collection and cleaning Completed Udemy course dataset loaded and cleaned for nulls and duplicates 2 Feature engineering Completed Combined course title, subject, and level into a single text feature for TF-IDF 3 Model training and similarity computation Completed TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity used; fuzzy matching (RapidFuzz) integrated 4 User input and recommendation logic Completed Supports title, partial title, and topic-based recommendations 5 Web login page In Progress Teammate responsible; will handle user session tracking 6 Course selection page (Frontend UI) In Progress UI to accept course/topic inputs and display recommendations 7 Backend API (model connection) Pending Mock API planned initially; real model API integration next 8 Deployment and testing Pending To be done post UI completion and API integration Dependencies: ● Model integration (Task 7) depends on successful completion of the web frontend (Tasks 5–6). ● Deployment (Task 8) depends on model + API readiness.

Commit Highlights: 3. Demonstration of Completed Work Work Completed and Verified: ● TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity successfully implemented. ● Popularity weighting using subscriber count added. ● Fuzzy title matching integrated for user flexibility. ● Console-based interactive recommendation system tested on Udemy dataset. Example Run: Input: ["Python", "machine learning"] Output: Top 10 relevant course recommendations with titles, subjects, and subscriber counts. Performance & Quality: ● Uses TF-IDF to capture topic similarity efficiently.
● Fuzzy matching improves user experience by handling spelling or partial matches. ● Popularity weighting refines results to show trending or high-rated courses. Example Output: Next Steps: ● Build Node mock API for model connection. ● Connect model to frontend UI to fetch and display recommendations dynamically. ● Add login tracking and personalized history-based recommendations.
